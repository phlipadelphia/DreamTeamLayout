## DreamTeamLayout
Team Profile Generator

My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Instructions

Run `npm test` to, well, run the tests. Run `node index.js' next to begin.

The following prompts will ask for information for any new manager, engineer or intern you'd like to add to the team!

Go to `Complete` once finished to render the `index.html` which you will then find in the `dist` folder.
